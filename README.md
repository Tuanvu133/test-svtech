# test-svtech
01 - Build a script to install base servers for a production environment, and use any automation tools that suit you (ansible*, salt stack, terraform, bash...). The solution should set up the following components, and make any changes as you see fit so that we can assess your consideration for a production-grade system.
"Sysadmin" accounts with sudo privilege; hostname (dns); cli commands you use often.
Install docker daemon, specify logging driver + storage driver of your choice.
The server should be prepared/tuned for a high network traffic workload.
Logging Every Command Executed by Users and saving in a specific file.

02 - Describe your idea to monitor the resource utilization of a Tech Stack. Draw a model that is Scalable, Resilient, and Responsive to the most traffic you have ever deployed. 

03 - When you receive an alert that a service is down or slow, what would you do to check that service and resolve the issue? Describe your steps to resolve and prevent the problem (you can describe a real situation that you have encountered).
